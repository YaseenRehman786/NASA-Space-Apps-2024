Hello and welcome from the OTU Space Innovators Team, Yaseen Rehman and Aaron Emanual 

Please read this file to understand how our folder is organized

We first played around with the code provided to us from the NASA Resources: [NASA Space Apps TEST DATA.ipynb](<NASA Space Apps TEST Data.ipynb>)
We then created a notebook to run and confirm all the test data and train our algorithm: [OTU Innovators NASA TRAINING](<OTU Innovators NASA TRAINING Data.ipynb>)

~FINAL CODE~
This is our final code where you can read any of the lunar or mars data and it will provide you with the seismic event and output a file with that timestamp: [text](<OTU Innovators NASA TEST Data.ipynb>)
    Additionally, we already ran through 6 examples, 3 from lunar and 3 from mars, found the seismic even per each data set, and output the 6 files
